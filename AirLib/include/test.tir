Using the PAC2002Tire Model
QFCX1    = 0.1        $Tire stiffness interaction with Fx
QFCY1    = 0.3        $Tire stiffness interaction with Fy
QFCG1    = 0.0        $Tire stiffness interaction with camber
QFZ1     = 0.0        $Linear stiffness coefficient, if zero, 
VERTICAL_STIFFNESS is taken
QFZ2     = 14.35      $Tire vertical stiffness coefficient (quadratic)
