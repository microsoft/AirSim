Description: # Python API Examples for AirSim
        
        This folder contains Python package and examples for [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/airsim).
        
        ## Pre-requisites
        Please make sure you have installed Python package for msgpack (this needs administrator/sudo prompt):
        ```
        pip install msgpack-rpc-python
        ```
        
        Some examples requires opencv. You can install required packages by running `install_packages.bat`.
        
        Note: Do not run `setup.py`. It is meant for creating python package.
        
        ## How to Run
        Try out `car/hello_car.py` or `multirotor\hello_drone.py`. 
        You can run them either from Visual Studio solution or from command line like usual Python scripts.
        Also explore other examples.
        
        ## Folder Structure
        
        The `airsim` folder contains wrapper over msgpack APIs to expose AirSim APIs in friendly Pythonic way. 
        Other folders contains example code for how to use APIs.
