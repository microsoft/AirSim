# airsim_ros_pkgs

A ROS wrapper over the AirSim C++ client library.

## Setup

The below steps are meant for Linux. If you're running AirSim on Windows, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run the ROS wrapper, see the instructions [below](#setting-up-the-build-environment-on-windows10-using-wsl1-or-wsl2). If you're unable or don't prefer to install ROS and related tools on your host Linux due to some issues, you can also try it using Docker, see the steps in [Using Docker for ROS wrapper](#using-docker-for-ros)

- If your default GCC version is not 8 or above (check using `gcc --version`)

    - Install gcc >= 8.0.0: `sudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8`
    - Verify installation by `gcc-8 --version`

- Ubuntu 16.04
    * Install [ROS kinetic](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
    * Install tf2 sensor and mavros packages: `sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-tf2-sensor-msgs ros-kinetic-tf2-geometry-msgs ros-kinetic-mavros*`

- Ubuntu 18.04
    * Install [ROS melodic](https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
    * Install tf2 sensor and mavros packages: `sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-tf2-sensor-msgs ros-melodic-tf2-geometry-msgs ros-melodic-mavros*`
- Ubuntu 20.04
    * Install [ROS noetic](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
    * Install tf2 sensor and mavros packages: `sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-tf2-sensor-msgs ros-melodic-tf2-geometry-msgs ros-melodic-mavros*`

- Install [catkin_tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)
    `sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools` or
    `pip install catkin_tools`. If using Ubuntu 20.04 use `pip install "git+https://github.com/catkin/catkin_tools.git#egg=catkin_tools"`

## Build

- Build AirSim

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim.git;
cd AirSim;
./setup.sh;
./build.sh;
```

- Make sure that you have setup the environment variables for ROS as mentioned in the installation pages above. Add the `source` command to your `.bashrc` for convenience (replace `melodic` with specfic version name) -

```shell
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- Build ROS package

```shell
cd ros;
catkin build; # or catkin_make
```

If your default GCC isn't 8 or greater (check using `gcc --version`), then compilation will fail. In that case, use `gcc-8` explicitly as follows-

```shell
catkin build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-8 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8
```

## Running

```shell
source devel/setup.bash;
roslaunch airsim_ros_pkgs airsim_node.launch;
roslaunch airsim_ros_pkgs rviz.launch;
```

   **Note**: If you get an error running `roslaunch airsim_ros_pkgs airsim_node.launch`, run `catkin clean` and try again

## Using AirSim ROS wrapper

The ROS wrapper is composed of two ROS nodes - the first is a wrapper over AirSim's multirotor C++ client library, and the second is a simple PD position controller.
Let's look at the ROS API for both nodes:

## Misc

### Setting up the Build Environment on Windows10 using WSL1 or WSL2

These setup instructions describe how to setup "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows" (aka "Windows Subsystem for Linux").

It involves enabling the built-in Windows Linux environment (WSL) in Windows10, installing a compatible Linux OS image, and finally installing the build environment as if it were a normal Linux system.

Upon completion, you will be able to build and run the ros wrapper as in a native linux machine.

##### WSL1 vs WSL2

WSL2 is the latest version of the Windows10 Subsystem for Linux. It is many times faster than WSL1 (if you use the native file system in `/home/...` rather
than Windows mounted folders under `/mnt/...`) and is therefore much preferred for building the code in terms of speed.

Once installed, you can switch between WSL1 or WSL2 versions as you prefer.

##### WSL Setup steps

1. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Check that the ROS version you want to use is supported by the Ubuntu version you want to install.

2. Congratulations, you now have a working Ubuntu subsystem under Windows, you can now go to [Ubuntu 16 / 18 instructions](#setup) and then [How to run Airsim on Windows and ROS wrapper on WSL](#how-to-run-airsim-on-windows-and-ros-wrapper-on-wsl)!

!!! note

    You can run XWindows applications (including SITL) by installing [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)  on Windows.
    To use it find and run `XLaunch` from the Windows start menu.
    Select `Multiple Windows` in first popup, `Start no client` in second popup, **only** `Clipboard` in third popup. Do **not** select `Native Opengl` (and if you are not able to connect select `Disable access control`).
    You will need to set the DISPLAY variable to point to your display: in WSL it is `127.0.0.1:0`, in WSL2 it will be the ip address of the PC's network port and can be set by using the code below. Also in WSL2 you may have to disable the firewall for public networks, or create an exception in order for VcXsrv to communicate with WSL2:

    `export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0`

!!! tip

    - If you add this line to your ~/.bashrc file you won't need to run this command again
    - For code editing you can install VSCode inside WSL.
    - Windows 10 includes "Windows Defender" virus scanner. It will slow down WSL quite a bit. Disabling it greatly improves disk performance but increases your risk to viruses so disable at your own risk. Here is one of many resources/videos that show you how to disable it: [How to Disable or Enable Windows Defender on Windows 10](https://youtu.be/FmjblGay3AM)

##### File System Access between WSL and Windows10

From within WSL, the Windows drives are referenced in the /mnt directory. For example, in order to list documents within your (<username>) documents folder:

    `ls /mnt/c/'Documents and Settings'/<username>/Documents`
    or
    `ls /mnt/c/Users/<username>/Documents`


From within Windows, the WSL distribution's files are located at (type in windows Explorer address bar):

   `\\wsl$\<distribution name>`
   e.g.
   `\\wsl$\Ubuntu-18.04`

##### How to run Airsim on Windows and ROS wrapper on WSL

For WSL 1 execute:
`export WSL_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1`
and for WSL 2:
`export WSL_HOST_IP=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}')`
Now, as in the [running section for linux](#running), execute the following:

```shell
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch airsim_ros_pkgs airsim_node.launch output:=screen host:=$WSL_HOST_IP
roslaunch airsim_ros_pkgs rviz.launch
```

### Using Docker for ROS

A Dockerfile is present in the [`tools`](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/tree/master/tools/Dockerfile-ROS) directory. To build the `airsim-ros` image -

```shell
cd tools
docker build -t airsim-ros -f Dockerfile-ROS .
```

To run, replace the path of the AirSim folder below -

```shell
docker run --rm -it --net=host -v <your-AirSim-folder-path>:/home/testuser/AirSim airsim-ros:latest bash
```

The above command mounts the AirSim directory to the home directory inside the container. Any changes you make in the source files from your host will be visible inside the container, which is useful for development and testing. Now follow the steps from [Build](#build) to compile and run the ROS wrapper.
