# Upgrading Unreal Engine Version

If you are using old version of AirSim with Unreal Engine 4.14 or earlier, please use below steps to upgrade to 4.15.

1. Windows + S and type Epic Games Launcher.
2. Switch to Library tab on the right.
3. Click on Add Version in Engine Versions section and select 4.15.
4. Click on Install. This would typically take few minutes because of large download.
5. Once install is complete, Launch button will appear. Click on it to launch UE Editor.
6. In UE Editor you should see your Unreal project bit greyed out. If you don't then use the browse button to navigate to your .uproject file.
7. Double click on the project. A warning might appear saying that there might be incompatibility. The warning box might show only "Open Copy" button. Don't click that. Instead click on More Options which will reveal more buttons. Choose Convert-In-Place option. Causion: Always keep backup of your project first!
8. If you don't have anything nasty, in place conversion should go through and you are now on new version of Unreal!
