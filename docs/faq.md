## General
<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### Unreal editor is slow when it is not the active window

>Go to Edit/Editor Preferences, select "All Settings" and type "CPU" in the search box.
>It should find the setting titled "Use Less CPU when in Background", and you want to uncheck this checkbox.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### My mouse disappears in Unreal

>Yes, Unreal steals the mouse, and we don't draw one.  So to get your mouse back just use Alt+TAB to switch to a different window. To avoid this entirely, go to Project settings >in Unreal Editor, go to Input tab and disable all settings for mouse capture.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### Where is the setting file and how do I modify it?

>AirSim will create empty settings file at `~/Documents/AirSim/settings.json`. You can view the available [settings options](settings.md).

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### How do I arm my drone?

>If you're using simple_flight, your vehicle is already armed and ready to fly. For PX4 you can arm by holding both sticks on remote control down and to the center.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### When making API call I get error

>If you are getting this error,
>```
>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'AsyncIOLoop' and 'float'
>```
>its probably due to upgraded version of tornado package with version > 5.0 in Python that conflicts with `msgpack-rpc-python` which requires tornado package < 5.0. To fix this >you can update the package like this:
>```
>pip install --upgrade msgpack-rpc-python
>```
>But this might break something (for example, PyTorch 0.4+) because it will uninstall newer tornado and re-install older one. To avoid this you should create new [conda >environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### I'm getting Eigen not found error when compiling Unreal project.
>This is most likely because AirSim wasn't built and Plugin folder was copied in Unreal project folder. To fix this make sure you [build AirSim](build_windows.md) first (run >`build.cmd` in Windows).

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### Something went wrong. How do I debug?

>First turn on C++ exceptions from the Exceptions window:

>![exceptions](images/exceptions.png)

>and copy the stack trace of all exceptions you see there during execution that look relevant (for example, there might be an initial exception from VSPerf140 that you can >ignore) then paste these call stacks into a new AirSim GitHub issue, thanks.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### What do the colors mean in the Segmentation View?

>See [Camera Views](camera_views.md) for information on the camera views and how to change them.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### Unreal 4.xx doesn't look as good as 4.yy

>Unreal 4.15 added the ability for Foliage LOD dithering to be disabled on a case-by-case basis by unchecking the `Dithered LOD Transition` checkbox in the foliage materials. >Note that all materials used on all LODs need to have the checkbox checked in order for dithered LOD transitions to work.  When checked the transition of generated foliage will >be a lot smoother and will look better than 4.14.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### Can I use an XBox controller to fly?

>See [XBox controller](xbox_controller.md) for details.

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### Can I build a hexacopter with AirSim?

>See [how to build a hexacopter](https://github.com/microsoft/airsim/wiki/hexacopter).

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### How do I use AirSim with multiple vehicles?

>Here is [multi-vehicle setup guide](multi_vehicle.md).

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### What computer do you need?
>It depends on how big your Unreal Environment is. The Blocks environment that comes with AirSim is very basic and works on typical laptops. The
>[Modular Neighborhood Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/modular-neighborhood-pack) that we use ourselves for research requires GPUs with at least 4GB of RAM. The
>[Open World environment](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/open-world-demo-collection) needs GPU with 8GB RAM. Our typical development machines have 32GB of RAM and
>NVIDIA TitanX and a [fast hard drive](hard_drive.md).

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

###### How do I report issues?

>It's a good idea to include your configuration like below. If you can also include logs, that could also expedite the investigation.

>```
>Operating System: Windows 10 64bit
>CPU: Intel Core i7
>GPU: Nvidia GTX 1080
>RAM: 32 GB
>Flight Controller: Pixhawk v2
>Remote Control: Futaba
>```

>If you have modified the default `~/Document/AirSim/settings.json`, please include your
>settings also.

>If you are using PX4 then try to [capture log from MavLink or PX4](px4_logging.md).

>File an issue through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/airsim/issues).
