# Download Binaries

## Windows
Download the binaries for the environment of your choice from the [latest release](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/releases).

You can drive the car using keyboard, gamepad or steering wheel. However to fly drone manually, you will need either XBox controller or RC. Please see [remote control setup](remote_control.md) for more details. Alternatively you can use [APIs](apis.md) for programmatic control or use so-called [Computer Vision mode](image_apis.md) to move around in environment using the keyboard.

If you want to set up your own Unreal environment then please see [these instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/#how-to-get-it).

## Linux
Binaries for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is coming soon. For now you will need to [build it on Linux](build_linux.md) yourself.
